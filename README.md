# NebulaBunny · FREEZE Verification Demo

**Reproducible · Auditable · Offline by Design**

NebulaBunny is a quantitative backtesting and verification engine — a framework that makes algorithmic trading
experiments reproducible and auditable.
Its FREEZE layer provides a fully offline replay mechanism, allowing any backtest to be verified bit-by-bit without revealing code or data.

### What it Does
- **Freeze / Playback → Verification & Audit**  
- **Compliance → Chain of Evidence**  
- **spec_hash → Calibrated & Locked**

Each experiment is fingerprinted and sealed into a FREEZE package.
When re-played, every byte and checksum align exactly — no Internet, no code disclosure, no hidden data flow.
